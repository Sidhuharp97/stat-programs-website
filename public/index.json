However, there is often substantial spatial variation not fully captured by blocking, particularly in large experiments. Although spatial statistics have demonstrated effectiveness in controlling localized spatial variation, they are rarely integrated into analysis of agricultural field experiments. The purpose of this workshop is to provide tools for diagnosing with-field spatial variation and accounting for that spatial variation in statistical analysis of trial data. The workshop draws heavily from our book on this subject.\nIntended Audience This workshop is open to scientists, students, technicians and anyone else who conducts planned field experiments that are arranged in a regular gridded layout. Attendees will need a laptop with R or SAS installed. Some knowledge of programming in R (if you follow the R track) or SAS (if you follow the SAS track) is assumed: setting a working directory, importing files, loading libraries, calling functions. Familiarity with randomized complete block design and how to analyze that design is also assumed.\nHow to Prepare R\nYou will need a recent version of R, available free through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). While this is sufficient for running R scripts, You may also find it helpful to use RStudio, which provides a nice graphical user interface for R. RStudio can be downloaded here. Additionally, there are several package to download:\n\rcheck your system\r\r\rSAS\nIn order to run the SAS portion of this tutorial, a valid copy of SAS Base and Stat products and a current SAS license are required. This tutorial was built using SAS 9.4 (TS1M5). Although older versions of SAS may also work, we have not evaluated this. Users can also consider downloading and using a free version of SAS® On Demand for Academics: Studio.\nThe workshop will use Rstudio and the standard SAS interface for R and SAS code demonstrations, respectively.\nData sets\nThe following files will be used in the workshop:\nNebraska Interstate Nursery, a wheat variety trial arranged in a randomised complete block design with 4 blocks. This data set was first described by W. Stroup (2004) and has been used extensively for spatial analysis.\nLind, a winter wheat variety trial from Washington using an augmented design. This data set was kindly donated by Kimberly Garland Campbell of the USDA-ARS.\nPlease download these in advance so you can run the R and/or SAS scripts in the workshop.\nDraft Schedule    Time Topic     9:00 welcome/intro   9:20 diagnosing spatial autocorrelation   10:00 10-minute break   10:10 code demo   11:05 row-by-column designs   11:30 empirical variograms   12:00 1-hour lunch   13:00 questions   13:15 code demo   14:00 10-minute break   14:10 splines + code demo   14:40 model compariso + code demo   15:00 augmented designn + code demo   16:00 Adjourn    This schedule may be adjusted as the workshop unfolds.\nMeet Your Instructors Julia Piaskowski is an agricultural statistician at the University of Idaho, Software Carpentry Certified Instructor and long-time R programmer.\nXin Dai is consulting statistician at Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University with 12 years of experience in SAS programming.\n\rbegin the workshop\r\r\rThis workshop is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.

This attribute of trial data impacts many aspects of spatial analysis\r\r\rSpatial autocorrelation refers to similarity between points that are close to one another. That correlation is expected to decline with distance. Note that is different from experiment-wide gradients, such as a salinity gradient or position on a slope.\nPlotting One of the easiest ways to diagnose spatial autocorrelation is by plotting data by its spatial position and using a heat map to indicate values of a response variable.\n\r While there is always ambiguity associated with using plots for decision making, early exploration of these plots can be helpful in understanding the extent of spatial correlation.\nMoran\u0026rsquo;s I Moran\u0026rsquo;s I, sometimes called \u0026ldquo;Global Moran\u0026rsquo;s I\u0026rdquo; can be used for conducting a hypothesis test on whether there is correlation between spatial units located adjacent to one another.\n$$ I = \\frac{N}{W}\\frac{\\sum_i \\sum_j w_{ij} (x_i - \\bar{x})(x_j - \\bar{x})}{\\sum_i(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\qquad i \\neq j$$\nWhere N is total number of spatial locations indexed by $i$ and $j$, x is the variable of interest, $w_{ij}$ are a spatial weights between each $i$ and $j$, and W is the sum of all weights.\nThe expected values of Moran\u0026rsquo;s I is $-1/(N-1)$. Values greater than the expected value indicate positive spatial correlation (areas close to each other are similar), while values less than that indicate dissimilarity as spatial distance between points decreases.\nDefining Neighbors There are several options for defining adjacent neighbors and how to weight each neighbor\u0026rsquo;s influence. The two common configurations for defining neighbors are the rook and queen configurations. These are exactly what their chess analogy suggests: \u0026ldquo;rook\u0026rdquo; defines neighbors in an row/column fashion, while \u0026ldquo;queen\u0026rdquo; defines neighbors in a row/column configuration an also neighbors located diagonally at a 45 degree angle from the row/column neighbors. Determining this can be complicated when working with irregularly-placed data (e.g. counties), but is quite unambiguous for lattice data common in planned field experiments.\n\r Setting the values for weights is a function of both how neighbors are defined and their proximity to the unit of interest. However, a very popular method is to define each neighbor as equal fractions that sum to one, e.g. in rook formation, each neighbor is weighted 0.25 (assuming an interior plot with 4 neighbors).\nEmpirical variogram This is one of the most useful methods of determining the extent of spatial variability and will be covered in the following sections.\nCode for this section R\r# load libraries\rlibrary(dplyr); library(ggplot2); library(desplot); library(spdep); library(sf); library(nlme)\r# read in data and prepare it\rNin \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;stroup_nin_wheat.csv\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(col.width = col * 1.2, row.length = row * 4.3) %\u0026gt;% mutate(name = case_when(is.na(as.character(rep)) ~ NA_character_, TRUE ~ as.character(gen))) %\u0026gt;% arrange(col, row)\rNin_na \u0026lt;- filter(Nin, !is.na(rep))\r# make exploratory plot\rggplot(Nin, aes(x = row, y = col)) +\rgeom_tile(aes(fill = yield), col = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_tileborder(aes(group = 1, grp = rep), lwd = 1.2) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;row\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;column\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;field plot layout\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() +\rtheme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\raxis.title = element_text(size = 14),\rlegend.title = element_text(size = 14),\rlegend.text = element_text(size = 12))\r## conduct moran's I test ##\r# set neighbors with convenience function for grids\rxy_rook \u0026lt;- cell2nb(nrow = max(Nin$row), ncol = max(Nin$col), type=\u0026quot;rook\u0026quot;, torus = FALSE, legacy = FALSE) # run linear mixed model and extract residuals\rnin.lme \u0026lt;- lme(fixed = yield ~ gen, random = ~1|rep,\rdata = Nin, na.action = na.exclude)\rresid_lme \u0026lt;- residuals(nin.lme)\rnames(resid_lme) \u0026lt;- Nin$plot\r# two version of the Moran's I test: moran.test(resid_lme, nb2listw(xy_rook), na.action = na.exclude)\rmoran.mc(resid_lme, nb2listw(xy_rook), 999, na.action = na.exclude)\r  SAS\r# read in data\rproc format;\rinvalue has_NA\r'NA' = .;\r;\rfilename NIN url \u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IdahoAgStats/guide-to-field-trial-spatial-analysis/master/data/stroup_nin_wheat.csv\u0026quot;;\rdata alliance;\rinfile NIN firstobs=2 delimiter=',';\rinformat yield has_NA.;\rinput entry $ rep $ yield col row;\rRow = 4.3*Row;\rCol = 1.2*Col;\rif yield=. then delete;\rrun;\r# heatmap\rproc sgplot data=alliance;\rHEATMAPPARM y=Row x=Col COLORRESPONSE=yield/ colormodel=(blue yellow green); run;\r# linear mixed model\rproc mixed data=alliance;\rclass Rep Entry;\rmodel Yield = Entry / outp=residuals;\rrandom Rep;\rrun;\r# Moran's I\rproc variogram data=residuals plots(only)=moran ;\rcompute lagd=1.2 maxlag=30 novariogram autocorr(assum=nor) ;\rcoordinates xc=row yc=col;\rvar resid;\rrun;\r  ","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"bbf124f1c429d14c54ba274fe608c4a2","permalink":"/events/workshops/spatial-workshop/diagnosis/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/workshops/spatial-workshop/diagnosis/","section":"events","summary":"This workshop is concerned with areal data, that is, data that occurs in discrete units (plots, in most cases).

Additional, SAS and the proprietary software asreml can implement a mixed model with this covariance structure.\nBooks for the deep dive \r   Statistics for Spatial Data\n  Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R, available for free\n  Spatio-Temporal Statistics With R (also free)\n  Spatial Data Analysis in Ecology and Agriculture Using R\n  ","date":1636243200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636243200,"objectID":"f4c344325c395cf7d4a14875fb68e0e1","permalink":"/events/workshops/spatial-workshop/conclusion/","publishdate":"2021-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/workshops/spatial-workshop/conclusion/","section":"events","summary":"Spatial analysis can be challenging, but I think it is worth the effort to learn and implement in analysis of field trials.

It is part of the tidyverse It can be complicated to use. It derived from the “grammar of graphics” concept that aims to have a consistent set of options to build a diverse set of simple or complex plots from data.\nData and packages We will load ggplot2, which will automatically load a useful package of color palette, ‘RColorBrewer’. The packages ‘dplyr’, ‘forcats’ and ‘data.table’ are loaded since we will need to use some of their functions to prepare the data for plots.\nThe data set, “nass.hay” is from the ‘agridat’ package. It is historic data on hay production across U.S. states from 1909 to 2012 gathered by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. This script also creates a data object only containing data from Idaho, and a data object with hay production stats from 2012.\nlibrary(agridat) # loaded so we can access the following date set:\rdata(\u0026quot;nass.hay\u0026quot;)\rstr(nass.hay)\r## 'data.frame': 5044 obs. of 4 variables:\r## $ year : int 1909 1909 1909 1909 1909 1909 1909 1909 1909 1909 ...\r## $ state: Factor w/ 49 levels \u0026quot;Alabama\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Alaska\u0026quot;,..: 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...\r## $ acres: num 275000 98000 409000 2503000 1180000 ...\r## $ yield: num 0.96 2.42 1.05 1.61 1.73 1.15 1.22 0.69 0.86 2.16 ...\rhead(nass.hay)\r## year state acres yield\r## 1 1909 Alabama 275000 0.96\r## 2 1909 Arizona 98000 2.42\r## 3 1909 Arkansas 409000 1.05\r## 4 1909 California 2503000 1.61\r## 5 1909 Colorado 1180000 1.73\r## 6 1909 Connecticut 387000 1.15\rhay_idaho \u0026lt;- filter(nass.hay, state == \u0026quot;Idaho\u0026quot;) hay2012 \u0026lt;- filter(nass.hay, year == 2012)\rhay_pnw \u0026lt;- filter(nass.hay, state %in% c(\u0026quot;Oregon\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Washington\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Montana\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Idaho\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(state = fct_drop(state)) # fct_drop() command run so extra factor levels in \u0026quot;state\u0026quot; that are not longer represented in \u0026quot;hay_pnw\u0026quot; are dropped  Basics of ggplot A ggplot needs 3 parts:  data aesthetics which connect or map the data to the geom a type of plot, or geom, to implement  Note:\n ggplot2 uses the + notation in their plots (see below). I think there is some regret over this style decision, but it is now an accepted convention! ggplot2 also uses non-standard evaluation, so, often column names do not need to be quoted common mapping aesthetics:  x (the x variable) y (the y variable) col (color for lines, points, outlines) fill (color when something has a fill color such as a boxplot) group (when a plotted option should be grouped, then plotted)    build a simple plot Let’s plot Yield over time for Idaho hay production\nStep 1: Add the data ggplot(hay_idaho)\r (not much to see here - we have not specified the aesthetics or the geom)\nStep 2: Add aesthetics ggplot(hay_idaho, mapping = aes(x = year, y = yield))\r This step mapped “year” and “yield” from the hay_idaho data set to the x and y axes, respectively. Nothing is plotted because we have not specified what type of plot geom we want.\nStep 3: Add a geom (explicit mapping command dropped - use a positional argument instead)\nggplot(hay_idaho, aes(x = year, y = yield)) +\rgeom_line()\r Question: What happens if we use %\u0026gt;% instead of +?\nCommon plot improvements plot title and axis labels ggplot(hay_idaho, aes(x = year, y = yield)) +\rgeom_line() +\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Total historic hay yields in Idaho\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;Year\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;yield (1000s of tons)\u0026quot;)\r Change line settings (and other geom arguments)\nggplot(hay_idaho, aes(x = year, y = yield)) +\rgeom_line(color = \u0026quot;turquoise\u0026quot;, size = 1.5, linetype = 1) +\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Total historic hay yields in Idaho\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;Year\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;yield (1000's of tons)\u0026quot;)\r The default line type is “1”, which is a plain line. There are other types:\nOther common geoms: points ggplot(hay_idaho, aes(x = year, y = yield)) +\rgeom_point(shape = 2, col = \u0026quot;navy\u0026quot;) +\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Total historic hay yields in Idaho\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;Year\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;yield (1000s of tons)\u0026quot;)\r There are many options for the type of plotting character (“pch” in base R plotting and “shape” in ggplot):\nThe default shape is “1” (the circle). Plotting symbols 21 - 25 have outline color and fill attributes, while the other symbols only take a single color argument.\narea ggplot(hay_idaho, aes(x = year, y = yield)) +\rgeom_area(fill = \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;, col = \u0026quot;gray20\u0026quot;) +\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Total historic hay yields in Idaho\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;Year\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;yield (1000s of tons)\u0026quot;)\r boxplot ggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = state, y = yield)) +\rgeom_boxplot() +\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Yearly hay yields in the Pacific Northwest\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;State\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;yield (1000s of tons)\u0026quot;)\r Color all boxplots the same:\nggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = state, y = yield)) +\rgeom_boxplot(fill = \u0026quot;yellow\u0026quot;) +\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Yearly hay yields in the Pacific Northwest\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;State\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;yield (1000s of tons)\u0026quot;)\r Color boxplots by state:\n(This requires an aes statement.)\nggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = state, y = yield, fill = state)) +\rgeom_boxplot() +\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Yearly hay yields in the Pacific Northwest\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;State\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;yield (1000s of tons)\u0026quot;)\r Question: What happens if we specify “color = state” instead of “fill = state”?\nhistograms and density plots: ggplot(hay_idaho, aes(x = yield)) +\rgeom_histogram(fill = \u0026quot;gray70\u0026quot;, col = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, bins = 20)\r## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).\r Unlike in base R plotting, creating a density plot and shading the are under the curve is easy.\nggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = yield, fill = state)) +\rgeom_density()\r In this plot, it is hard to see what is going on since the each distribution covers up the one plotted before it (so we can’t really see Idaho, but Washington’s hay yield distribution is clear). The attribute “alpha” can be used to add a transparency to colors. The code is alpha = n where n is the proportion of the color that is shown (0 is completely transparent and 1 is no transparency).\nggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = yield, fill = state)) +\rgeom_density(alpha = 0.5)\r Combining geoms Geoms are best thought of as plotting layers. Additional geoms can be added to a single plot, adding additional layers of information. Each geom is added to the plot in the order it is specified in the ggplot statement.\nAdding an overall of points over boxplots is a good way to summarise the empirical distribution of a large number of data points:\nggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = state, y = yield, fill = state)) +\rgeom_boxplot() +\rgeom_point() +\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Yearly hay yields in the Pacific Northwest\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;State\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;yield (1000s of tons)\u0026quot;)\r In this example, it is likely there is over-plotting of data since each state has 104 data point associated with it. The geom geom_jitter() can be used to jiggle overlapping points. Points can be jittered in the vertical and horizontal direction. In this case, jittering in the horizontal direction will result in no change in the interpretation since the y-axis indicates actual value associated with each point.\nggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = state, y = yield, fill = state)) +\rgeom_boxplot() +\rgeom_jitter(width = 0.3, height = 0) +\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Yearly hay yields in the Pacific Northwest\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;State\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;yield (1000s of tons)\u0026quot;)\r Other common plotting options Faceting Sometimes, it is useful to create a set of similar plots with the same scaling. Facets are useful for this purpose.\nFor an example, below is a plot of the distributions from above using facet_grid().\nggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = yield)) +\rgeom_density(col = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;dodgerblue\u0026quot;, alpha = 0.6) +\rfacet_grid(. ~ state) # for a horizontal facet\r ggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = yield)) +\rgeom_density(col = \u0026quot;darkgreen\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;springgreen3\u0026quot;, alpha = 0.6) +\rfacet_grid(state ~ .) # for a vertical facet\r Faceting can also be done be used to create a grid of plots with facet_wrap():\nggplot(hay_pnw) +\rgeom_line(aes(x = year, y = yield), col = \u0026quot;darkcyan\u0026quot;) +\rfacet_wrap(. ~ state, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)\r Representing error information Example: create a band indicates the minimum and maximum range of values\nhay_yearly \u0026lt;- nass.hay %\u0026gt;% group_by(year) %\u0026gt;% summarise(Yield = mean(yield), yield_min = min(yield), yield_max = max(yield))\rggplot(hay_yearly, aes(x = year)) + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = yield_min, ymax = yield_max), fill = \u0026quot;gray70\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_line(aes(y = Yield), size = 0.8)\r Example: add error bars\nTwo other plot adjustments included: * indicate the range of numbers that the y-axis should span * flip the x and y axes\nhay_pnw_summary \u0026lt;- hay_pnw %\u0026gt;% group_by(state) %\u0026gt;% summarise(Yield = mean(yield, na.rm = T), yield_sd = sd(yield, na.rm = T))\rggplot(hay_pnw_summary, aes(x = state)) + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Yield - yield_sd, ymax = Yield + yield_sd), width = 0.2) +\rgeom_point(aes(y = Yield), shape = 18, size = 5, col = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;) +\rylim(c(0, 3.7)) +\rcoord_flip()\r Add regression lines to a plot P \u0026lt;- ggplot(hay_idaho, aes(x = acres, y = yield)) +\rgeom_point(shape = 16, alpha = 0.6, size = 2.5)\rP # Plots can be assigned to an object and then later added to\r P +\rgeom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;loess\u0026quot;, col = \u0026quot;yellowgreen\u0026quot;)\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\r Adjusting non-data items  Adjustments to the background, text size and other details are done in the theme() argument command. there are several pre-built themes:  Implementing a ggplot theme facet.plot \u0026lt;- ggplot(hay_pnw) +\rgeom_line(aes(x = year, y = yield), col = \u0026quot;darkcyan\u0026quot;) +\rfacet_wrap(. ~ state, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)\rfacet.plot + theme_minimal()  This is not exactly what I want. Larger labels on everything would be helpful, as well as an outline around each plot.

You you will inevitable need to consult help files at some point.\nA bit on colors R has a rich set of colors and some excellent palettes that provide excellent contrast and/or work for color-blind individuals. Several are automatically loaded with ggplot2, such as the RColorBrewer:\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\rdisplay.brewer.all()\r The package ‘viridis’ also has some nice color palettes that are widely used and accepted. Information about color palettes have been comprehensively explored by Emil Hvitfeldt and worth a read.\nOther Important Stuff How to save plots  The function ggsave() is the recommended approach. By default, it will save the the last plot created.  ggplot(hay_pnw) +\rgeom_line(aes(x = year, y = yield), col = \u0026quot;violetred\u0026quot;) +\rfacet_wrap(. ~ state, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)\r ggsave(\u0026quot;PNW_hay_production.png\u0026quot;, dpi = 400)\r  other acceptable formats:  .jpeg .tiff .bmp .svg .wmf (on windows machines) .pdf .eps .ps .tex .pd   can specify the size of the saved plot (in centimeters, millimeters or inches) and the resolution in DPI (dots per square inch)  Other great geoms    geom purpose     geom_violin() violin plot   geom_ribbon() horizontal filled undulating band   geom_bar() for creating bar plots   geom_abline(), geom_hline(), geom_vline() for adding straight lines to a plot   geom_map() part of the rich ecosystem of ggplot mapping functions   geom_rug() adds rug plots to edges of a plot    ggplot extensions Many packages have been developed to extend ggplot’s functionality.

The p-value is a number that results from a statistical test of a hypothesis and can be generally described as: The probability of a specified hypothesis given an observed set of data and the assumptions underlying the hypothesis. The hypothesis in question is typically the NULL hypothesis, which in controlled experiments is that there are no differences among treatments. Problems from p-values have come about from a variety of reasons including over reliance on statistical testing, misunderstanding and misinterpreting the meaning of a p-value, and deliberate or unconscious manipulation of results and analyses to obtain “desirable” p-values, a process referred to as p-hacking (see Greenland, et al. 2016 for a more comprehensive list of problems with p-values).\nOne common practice in research, including agriculture, is that of “bright line” testing where decisions on statistical significance and relevance are based strictly on p-values being greater or less than a specified value such as 0.05. Unfortunately, such decision rules have been repeatedly shown to perform poorly. Many aspects such as sample size, inaccurate hypotheses, incorrect analyses, violated assumptions and a slew of other, often uncontrollable, factors can interfere with this decision-making process. For many of us, this is a bitter pill to swallow. We, and I include myself here, have been trained or lulled into using statistical results in this manner and our minds naturally gravitate to this simplistic binary, accept/reject paradigm. The real world, however, is more complex and we should accommodate those complexities into our interpretations of research results. The question is then, how we should move forward.\nHow should we use p-values, or more importantly, how should we present research results. Some journals have taken the extreme step of banning p-values completely, i.e., Basic and Applied Social Psychology, while others have suggested methods such as applying multiple analytical techniques to the data to assess consistency in results, using more sophisticated Bayesian techniques to quantify the probability that a hypothesis is true, or emphasizing model estimates and their confidence bounds, rather than outcomes of testing. In most cases, practitioners generally agree that p-values can still play a role in model evaluation, but they are not the end of the story. A complete assessment of data should consider effect size (how different the estimates are in real terms), agreement with previous data/studies, and expert opinion in addition to p-values. The American Statistical Association lists 6 basic principles when considering p-values:\n P-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model. P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone. Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold. Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency. A p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result. By itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis.  How to not say Significant or Nonsignificant. OK, that’s all well and fine, but when it comes down to it, what do we write when reporting our analyses? There are many ways to answer this, and ultimately, the style will be up to the author. I find it useful to first recall and follow the distinction between Results and Discussion sections of the standard scientific reporting format. Results are for describing what you saw, while Discussions are for interpreting, speculating, and applying your scientific expertise to those results. Some examples:\nSuppose we have two dairy supplement treatments, A and B. An Analysis of Variance estimates the average milk production for the treatments in 3900 dairy cows as A: 30.30 kg/d and B: 31.83 kg/d; p = 0.0001. In a Results section, we might say something like “Treatment B was estimated to have greater mean milk production than treatment A (31.83 and 30.30, respectively; p=0.0001)”. However, in the Discussion section we could elaborate further with “While treatment B gave a higher milk yield than treatment A, the difference of 1.53 kg/d is not of practical importance and likely due to the large number of animals used.”\nAlternatively, suppose the estimated means were A: 30.30 kg/d and B: 45.62 kg/d; p=0.4328 in 34 dairy cows. Again, in the Results section, we could say “A higher milk yield was observed in treatment B compared to treatment A, although the difference was not detectable in this data (45.62 and 30.30 kg/d, respectively; p=0.4328).” A Discussion of these data could further explain “Although evidence for the difference in treatments A and B is limited, the 15.32 kg/d increase in milk yield of treatment B over A may warrant further investigation with a larger sample size.”\nPoints to remember: A small p-value does not indicate the strength of an effect and is not sufficient for drawing conclusions on treatment effects. Alternatively, a large p-value is not evidence of “no difference” in treatments. It simply implies that, with the data at hand and the model assumed, a difference could not be detected.\nIn general, employing common sense with professional modesty and avoiding strong declarative statements when reporting and discussing experimental results can go a long way towards averting p-value abuse. It may be useful to recall the research by Philip Tetlock regarding expert opinions Why Foxes Are Better Forecasters Than Hedgehogs: Pundants that make assertive statements with over confidence tend to be wrong in the long run, while those that are more tentative and conditional in their statements have a better track record. As scientists, we should strive to be a fox, not a hedgehog.\n","date":1663804800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618444800,"objectID":"e2e182520f0339333a6dd36f6ab4398c","permalink":"/post/p-values/","publishdate":"2022-09-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/p-values/","section":"post","summary":"Some lessons on proper interpretation and use of p-values","tags":null,"title":"Interpreting p-values","type":"post"},{"authors":["William Price"],"categories":["design","statistics","experiment","treatment"],"content":"In describing an experiment, we often use the word design. Design, however, can take on several meanings within the structure of a research study. This work summarizes an older article that describes this structure and the levels of design it is composed of (Urquhart, N. S. 1981). Understanding the types of design is not only useful for reporting on the study, but can also inform the analysis of the associated data.\nLevels of Design There are three main levels of design in a study: Treatment, Experimental, and Response. These each relate to the relationships between and among the treatments and their arrangement in the study.\nTreatment Design Treatment design describes how the experimental treatments relate to one another. The simplest treatment design is unstructured where there are no dependencies or relatedness among treatments. These could, for example, be various varieties, herbicides, or dietary supplement types. Alternatively, there may be an implied structure among the treatments such as rates or dosages where the treatments incrementally change by specified amounts. Another common treatment design is the complete factorial design where there are two or more types of treatments and all levels of each treatment type occur at all levels of the other types. They are typically denoted by the number of levels for each treatment type, e.g. a 2x3 factorial design or 3x4x2 factorial design. This structure is often modified by the addition of an untreated or standard control treatment, and in that case, we might describe the treatment design as a 2x3 + 1 factorial. There are also some specialized alternatives to the factorial where some treatment combinations are left out which are referred to as incomplete factorials.\nExperimental Design This is probably the most commonly used term for describing an experiment, however, it often confused with treatment design. Experimental design refers to how the treatments are randomized and organized physically relative to each other. It does not address how the treatments might be related, but only to how they are arranged in the experiment. The simplest experimental design is the Completely Random Design, or CRD. Here all treatments and their replications are assigned random positions within the experiment. There is no imposed structure to the arrangement. A very common modification of this has the treatments randomly assigned to positions within each replication. This randomization changes from replication to replication. This is the Randomized Complete Block or RCB design. Blocks here refer to groups or aggregations of complete sets of treatments. The randomization process is \u0026ldquo;restricted\u0026rdquo; to once per replication. With multiple factors such as a factorial treatment design, this can be extended to two or more restrictions on randomization within each replication leading to Split Plot and Split Block experimental designs. It is important to note, however, that this is independent of the treatment design. That is, a factorial such as the 2x3 above, could be imposed over any of these experimental designs, e.g. CRD or RCB, or Split Plot, etc.\nResponse Design Last category is the response design. This describes how the samples or observations relate to each other. A simple response design, for example, would have one sample/observation per treatment per replication. Or, we might have a sub-sampling response design where there are multiple samples or observations on each treatment in each replication. Another common response design is the repeated measures design where observations are taken sequentially through time on the same sampling unit. Sampling units are what the observations or samples themselves are made on. Examples here might be single pots or plants in a greenhouse study, plots in a field experiment, or animals in a feeding study. A similar concept is the experimental unit. This refers to what level of the experiment we draw inferences to. The experimental unit may be the same as the sampling unit, or it may be an aggregation of sampling units. For example, the experimental unit might be a single plot in a field experiment, however, we might take multiple soil samples from each plot (sampling units) which are then aggregated to a single value for the plot, the experimental unit. Typically this is done to mitigate or account for variability within the experimental unit.\nPutting this together Descriptions of a study for reporting or presentation should include all three levels of design. Doing so informs the audience as to what the treatment structure was, how it was arranged or randomized, and how it was sampled. This can be done in a few sentences. For example, we might say \u0026ldquo;Treatments consisted of Factor A at two levels and Factor B at three levels arranged in a 2x3 factorial treatment design. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with 4 blocks and three samples were taken from each experimental unit.\u0026quot;\nAnalyses of the study design will also incorporate and utilize all three levels of design. The details of this, however, are beyond the scope here and the reader is referred to the referenced article.\nReferences Urquhart, N. S. (1981). The anatomy of a study.

DON\u0026rsquo;T PANIC.\nAlthough SAS errors look confusing, SAS is really trying to help you find the problem. Really! Look in the Log Window for any error messages. They are marked in RED. Recall that SAS runs sequentially from top to bottom, so any mistakes at the top of the program will propagate more errors down the line. Always start by trying to fix the first error, then rerun the program. You may find that when the initial problems are fixed, the rest of the errors will vanish.\nWhen SAS gives an error message, it also lists a numeric code, like 201 or 76 indicating the line and character in the line where it had trouble. SAS will also underline the offending part of the program and mark it with the numeric code so you can match an error message with the problem area. It can\u0026rsquo;t always find the exact place where the problem occurred, but it usually close by. For more debugging information take a look at the TIPS below on common mistakes and problems.\nGood Luck!\nTips Missing Quotes: If you\u0026rsquo;ve recieved the \u0026ldquo;longer than 200 characters\u0026rdquo; message then the cause of the problem is easy to find. You have left out a quote somewhere. Carefully go back through the program and check for both beginning and ending quotes in any statements that use quoted strings such as TITLE, INFILE, or AXIS statements . Quoted strings in SAS are color coded as a magenta color to make them easier to see. Large blocks of text appearing this color are an indicator of a missing quote. Also note that single quotes are different than double quote characters. If you start a string with one of these and end with the other type, SAS will indicate a missing quote.\nAfter you find the culprit, fix it. But wait! Correcting the problem is not quite that easy (somehow you knew that!). SAS builds up the code you run sequentially. So if you try to run the \u0026ldquo;corrected\u0026rdquo; code, SAS will STILL be looking for an ending quote from last time. The quotes will still be unbalanced and you\u0026rsquo;ll still get an error message. This can be very frustrating, but here is the solution. First, correct the code, but before you run it, open a new editor window. Next, give SAS what it is looking for, the offending single quote. In the new editor window enter this: '; and submit that as a program. This will satisfy SAS (ignore any error messages at this point). Then, go back to the original program and run it. The \u0026ldquo;quote\u0026rdquo; problem should go away.\nMissing Semicolons: Leaving out a semicolon is probably the easiest mistake to make. The error message you get may vary here depending on where the mistake was made. Usually you get a message like \u0026ldquo;variable XXX not found\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;invalid option\u0026rdquo;. SAS is trying to interpret the errant statement as part of the preceding statement and, therefore, gets it\u0026rsquo;s cyberfeet tangled. The solution is straight forward: insert a ; and resubmit the program.\nMissing RUN Statement: Sometimes while running a program several times you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that the PROC LOTTERY you had at the end of your program is missing from the output listing. So, thinking that SAS maybe just \u0026ldquo;forgot\u0026rdquo; to run it the first time, you run the program again. Now you find it at the top of the output listing instead of the bottom! What the heck is going on!? Remember, SAS runs both sequentially and cumulatively. The first time you ran the program, SAS saw the PROC LOTTERY at the end, but didn\u0026rsquo;t find a RUN; statement. Without that it will hold on to the PROC LOTTERY and wait to execute it when it sees the next DATA or PROC step. When you run the program for the second time SAS first executes the PROC it is holding on to and then runs the submitted program (again, leaving off the last PROC). This can cause confusion to no end (no pun intended!). The solution, of course, is to put in the missing RUN;. By the way, before you go running to your SAS manuals looking for PROC LOTTERY, remember this is only and example!\nLISTING Window/File: Like other portions of SAS, the Listing and Log windows or output files may be cumulative. If you know you have changed your calculations for yield from lbs to kilograms, but SAS seems to keep printing lbs in the output, make sure you have cleared out the Listing window. You are probably looking at an \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; output created before you changed things. This also applies to the Log window.\nCase problems: SAS is creating too many levels of a variable, for example, when running PROC MIXED, PROC GLIMMIX or PROC FREQ. Go back and check the data very carefully. Alphabetic variables are case sensitive so the value \u0026ldquo;Trt1\u0026rdquo; is different from \u0026ldquo;TRT1\u0026rdquo;. This problem often creeps into programs when data has been combined over several years or locations. If you have this type of data, try to formulate a consistent template for yourself and others to use for entering data. Define what the treatment codes and variable names will be ahead of time. The only way to handle this problem is to change the data or use a data step and the IF statement to correct the problem.\n0 and O problems: SAS keeps insisting that it can\u0026rsquo;t find your variable \u0026ldquo;TRT0\u0026rdquo;, but you know it\u0026rsquo;s there in the INPUT statement! Check things carefully. You may have used O (capital letter oh) instead of 0, a zero. This is very easy to do and is made worse by the fact that the two are physically close together on most keyboards. Similar to problems with case above, this mix up may also show up as a problem when reading in data. The only solution is to change the problem characters to the appropriate values and try again. If this problem occurs a lot, you might consider trying a different font which uses a dot or slash when writing a zero.\nGeneral Debugging Tips: Debugging SAS can be a trying experience. Here are some techniques I use to help the process.\n  Build long complex programs a step at a time. Start by reading in the data. Print it. Check it. Then do any calculations, then add PROC steps and other DATA steps. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to write the whole thing at once. Verify that a piece of code works and then move on.\n  Use comments. Try to isolate problem code by commenting out sections of the program. This is a very useful technique. See Comments.\n  Try writing programs with consistent and readable structure. Use line breaks and indentation where needed and throw in comments to explain what is happening in the program. This will help organize the program flow in your mind and point out where things are going wrong. See Programming Habits.\n  Stay calm! Learning the quirks of SAS takes time. If all else fails let us know!\n  Some SAS Resources for Error Corrections:   Simply copy and paste the error message into a search engine like Google\n  Ask a question on the SAS forums:\n  Types of Errors in SAS\n  Beginning SAS books\n  Tips and Strategies for Mixed Modeling\n  ","date":1660089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618444800,"objectID":"986bccb7753c0e7b812d0057ff373c0f","permalink":"/post/sas-troubleshooting/","publishdate":"2022-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/sas-troubleshooting/","section":"post","summary":"Common errors you will encounter in SAS and how to fix them.","tags":null,"title":"Common Errors and Solutions in SAS","type":"post"},{"authors":["Julia Piaskowski"],"categories":["R","learning R"],"content":"R is a powerful tool, but, like any programming language, it takes an effort to.

R is powerful and agile language that is constantly undergoing improvements. As an open-source language, its utility is constantly expanded upon by user-contributed packages and additional developer resources. These include whole software packages like Rstudio, as well as tutorials, and cheatsheets. Keeping up with changes and advancements in this dynamic ecosystem is difficult. We have sought to provide resources for R users in agricultural research. We have established a central website to gather all related information, www.agstats.io that includes workshops, tutorials and short instructional blog posts. We also have built an accompanying “R Universe” repository, https://idahoagstats.r-universe.dev intended to serve as a guide to existing R packages serving different facets of agricultural research. Our goal is to help agricultural researchers fully utilize the array of available R resources to reach their goals.\n","date":1652659200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652659200,"objectID":"84a0a5e2304d15153614fe88f9ca71d8","permalink":"/events/presentations/agstats-conference-2022/","publishdate":"2022-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/presentations/agstats-conference-2022/","section":"events","summary":"A poster on current R resources to support agriculture research.","tags":["R","CRAN"],"title":"Tools and Resources for R Users in Agricultural Research","type":"events"},{"authors":["Julia Piaskowski"],"categories":["R","CRAN","agriculture"],"content":"Last updated: October 14, 2022\nUpdate: *This is now a CRAN Task View.

If you have been programming for any amount of time, you have learned that you are likely to encounter errors programming in R and resolving those coding errors can be challenging.\nFor most everyone, goggling an error message is the first step. This is not a bad choice as it often leads you to people who have already encountered the error and solved it. But, it can also lead you to a labyrinth of different, possible conflicting, possibly incomprehensible solutions. Additionally, it is not always the most time efficient method to solve a coding problem.\nSome Alternatives Check the documentation! There\u0026rsquo;s an ancient proverb about the importance of reading documentation: \u0026ldquo;you can spend 2 hours searching the web in order to save 15 minutes of reading the documentation.\u0026rdquo;\nPackage and function documentation can be very helpful. There are two main aspects of documentation:\n Function reference: this describes the arguments a function can take, the expected format for those arguments and information about the function object. It may also contain theoretical details that are needed to understand the argument options and examples. Documentation varies in quality greatly across R packages. It can occasionally be too bare bones to be useful, but often (especially in base R commands and tidyverse packages) the documentation is very detailed and helpful. Submission to CRAN requires that packages have a documentation file that lists all package function documentation in alphabetical order. Vignettes: these are tutorials accompanying how to use a package functions. These usually cover a subset of functions and include text explanations. They are basically long examples. Vignettes can be enormously helpful. They are not required for submission to CRAN, so they are not always available, especially for older legacy packages. You can find these on the package website (if it exists) or its CRAN link. Here are some vignettes from the package {tidyr}.  How do we find documentation? You find function documentation via the R console:\n?par # does an exact search on \u0026quot;par\u0026quot;\r??plot # does a fuzzy match on \u0026quot;plot\u0026quot;\r This will open help files for those items.\nSometimes, you will discover there are multiple options and possibly different help files associated with a function name (just run methods('mean') or methods('anova') to see what I mean).\nThese are functions that act differently depending on the R object type they are called to interact with (e.g. mean(some_dates) will behave differently than mean(some_numbers)). Which leads to the next point: all R objects have a class assigned to them. You can check this with class().\ny \u0026lt;- rnorm(20); x \u0026lt;- y + rnorm(20) m \u0026lt;- lm(y ~ x)\rclass(y)\r ## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;\r class(m)\r ## [1] \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;\r Understanding this difference between functions will help you understand which documentation files will help you solve your problem.\nMore importantly, once you know the object class, you can search for methods that exist for that class.\nmethods(class = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)\r ## [1] add1 alias anova case.names coerce ## [6] confint cooks.distance deviance dfbeta dfbetas ## [11] drop1 dummy.coef effects extractAIC family ## [16] formula hatvalues influence initialize kappa ## [21] labels logLik model.frame model.matrix nobs ## [26] plot predict print proj qr ## [31] residuals rstandard rstudent show simulate ## [36] slotsFromS3 summary variable.names vcov ## see '?methods' for accessing help and source code\r From this, we can see a special plot() option exists (that provides several diagnostic plots), functions for extracting residuals (rstudent(), residuals()), a version of anova() written for object type \u0026ldquo;lm\u0026rdquo;, and much much more.\nRead your error messages Error messages can be obtuse and confusing (especially if you are new to programming). We have all have experienced (and will experience again) this error message:\nIt is telling us we are trying to subset (extract) information from a \u0026lsquo;closure\u0026rsquo; (which is a function). In essence, there was an attempt to do something like mean$myvar when mean() is a function, not a data.frame.\nHowever, error messages can also be trying to tell you something important. Here\u0026rsquo;s a recent experience of mine:\nOver time, these messages will become comprehensible. It\u0026rsquo;s still the same messages, but your R knowledge will help you understand them. But, becoming fluent in R error messages implies reading them and trying to understand them.\nSpecific places to ask for help Eventually, you may need to search forums or ask for help from kind strangers. If Google fails you, here are some other useful resources:\n  RStudio Community, a helpful forum that is only for R questions. It is run by RStudio and moderated (to an extent). This is one of the more useful sites to search or post on.   R4DS community, a friendly, welcoming community. Join their slack channel and ask a question.\n  Stack overflow, the long-established site of all questions programming. Can often be helpful.   Consider reading the source code This is best for advanced users, but it can hep you resolve very specific questions about a function. Reading source code will also help improve your own coding.\n** How to find source code: **\n Type the function name in the console without parentheses:  mean.default\r ## function (x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...) ## {\r## if (!is.numeric(x) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !is.complex(x) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !is.logical(x)) {\r## warning(\u0026quot;argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\u0026quot;)\r## return(NA_real_)\r## }\r## if (isTRUE(na.rm)) ## x \u0026lt;- x[!is.na(x)]\r## if (!is.numeric(trim) || length(trim) != 1L) ## stop(\u0026quot;'trim' must be numeric of length one\u0026quot;)\r## n \u0026lt;- length(x)\r## if (trim \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; n) {\r## if (is.complex(x)) ## stop(\u0026quot;trimmed means are not defined for complex data\u0026quot;)\r## if (anyNA(x)) ## return(NA_real_)\r## if (trim \u0026gt;= 0.5) ## return(stats::median(x, na.rm = FALSE))\r## lo \u0026lt;- floor(n * trim) + 1\r## hi \u0026lt;- n + 1 - lo\r## x \u0026lt;- sort.int(x, partial = unique(c(lo, hi)))[lo:hi]\r## }\r## .Internal(mean(x))\r## }\r## \u0026lt;bytecode: 0x00000236dcfa19e8\u0026gt;\r## \u0026lt;environment: namespace:base\u0026gt;\r  Sometimes this is not informative  c\r ## function (...) .Primitive(\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;)\r subset\r ## function (x, ...) ## UseMethod(\u0026quot;subset\u0026quot;)\r## \u0026lt;bytecode: 0x00000236daf25fb8\u0026gt;\r## \u0026lt;environment: namespace:base\u0026gt;\r `[`\r ## .Primitive(\u0026quot;[\u0026quot;)\r  Use {the package {lookup} to find what you need  remotes::install_github(\u0026quot;jimhester/lookup\u0026quot;)\rlookup::lookup(`[`)\r {lookup} checks CRAN, Bioconductor and GitHub for source code!

Sure, you can cut-and-paste and change that one thing, or two things, or five things, but this quickly becomes cumbersome. The result can be a very long R file and the likelihood of making a mistake that you don\u0026rsquo;t notice increases (e.g. forgetting to change a variable or an argument).\nThere is the general rule of DRY: don\u0026rsquo;t repeat yourself. In practice, if something has to pasted more than twice, then consider writing a function to accomplish that aim instead.\nIntroduction to Writing Functions R functions follow a general structure:\nmy_function_name \u0026lt;- function(argument1, argument2) {\rfinal_output \u0026lt;- action(argument1, argument2)\rreturn(final_output)\r}\r A classic function example is conversion of temperature from Fahrenheit to celsius:\nfahr_to_cel \u0026lt;- function(fahr) {\r# function that converts temperature in degrees Fahrenheit to celsius\r# input: fahr: numeric value representing temp in degrees fahrenheit\r# output: kelvin: numeric converted temp in celsius\rcelsius \u0026lt;- ((fahr - 32) * (5 / 9)) return(celsius)\r}\r This function takes a numeric value, temperature in Fahrenheit, and outputs another numeric value, that same value converted to celsius.\nFunction usage:\nfahr_to_cel(80)\r ## [1] 26.66667\r This function can be called for a large number of values at once:\n# create a vector of 100 numbers randomly sampled between 1 and 100. x1 \u0026lt;- sample(1:100, 100, replace = TRUE)\rx2 \u0026lt;- fahr_to_cel(x1)\r If you provide the incorrect type of data, the function will not work:\nfahr_to_cel(\u0026quot;thirty\u0026quot;)\r ## Error in fahr - 32: non-numeric argument to binary operator\r A More Complex Example Often we want to do something more complicated. One thing I want to do frequently is build boxplots.\nFirst, simulate some data. This data set has two categorical variables, cat1 and cat2, and 4 different continuous variables generated through data simulation.\nmydata \u0026lt;- data.frame(cat1 = rep(c(\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;B\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;D\u0026quot;), 10),\rcat2 = rep(c(\u0026quot;one\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;two\u0026quot;), each = 20),\rvar1 = rnorm(40),\rvar2 = runif(40), var3 = rlnorm(40),\rvar4 = rbeta(40, 1, 5))\r Next, write up an example of what you want to do. In this example, let\u0026rsquo;s create a boxplot:\nboxplot(var1 ~ cat1, data = mydata,\rmain = NA, col = \u0026quot;orangered\u0026quot;)\r Now, let\u0026rsquo;s put that in a function. Start with the basic function framework:\nboxplot_func = function() {\r}\r Next, insert the function code. Start by cut-and-pasting the original boxplot command ran above:\nboxplot_func = function() {\rboxplot(var1 ~ cat1, data = mydata,\rmain = NA, col = \u0026quot;orangered\u0026quot;)\r}\r Decide on arguments you want to control and put that inside the function() parentheses. Probably the independent and dependent variable (x and y, respectively), as well as the data frame needed.\nPut those arguments inside function().\nboxplot_func = function(df, x, y) {\rboxplot(var1 ~ cat1, data = mydata,\rmain = NA, col = \u0026quot;orangered\u0026quot;)\r}\r Then indicate where those arguments are used in the function. They must be used in the function (otherwise, why have them?).\nboxplot_func = function(df, x, y) {\rboxplot(y ~ x, data = df,\rmain = NA, col = \u0026quot;orangered\u0026quot;)\r}\r However, if you try to use this function, it won\u0026rsquo;t work. The argument y ~ x is a special class of object in R called \u0026ldquo;formula\u0026rdquo; and the formatting and object type must match. Formulas are used widely in R for linear modelling and follow the exact same convention:\ny ~ x  Note that the information on either side of ~ can become more complicated. (but not in this function).\nSo, create a formula object using the functions formula() and paste() within the function and insert that into the basic boxplot code. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to use those function, type ?formula and ?paste into the console to learn more about them.\nboxplot_func = function(df, x, y) {\rf = formula(paste(y, \u0026quot;~\u0026quot;, x))\rboxplot(f, data = df,\rmain = NA, col = \u0026quot;orangered\u0026quot;)\r}\r What if you want the ability to change the color? Insert a new argument and replace it in the function body:\nboxplot_func = function(x, y, color) {\rf = formula(paste(y, \u0026quot;~\u0026quot;, x))\rboxplot(f, data = df,\rmain = NA, col = color)\r}\r If you want the option to set the some options or if you choose not to, have the function choose values automatically as defaults, that can be done by naming the argument in formula().\nboxplot_func = function(df = mydata, x, y, color = \u0026quot;springgreen\u0026quot;) {\rf = formula(paste(y, \u0026quot;~\u0026quot;, x))\rboxplot(f, data = df,\rmain = NA, col = color)\r}\r Next step is to run the function as it is currently written (highlight the function code and click run). Next, make sure you add this function (i.e. boxplot_funct = function(...)) to your R environment by running it in the console. You can check it exists in your R global environment as thus:\nls()\r ## [1] \u0026quot;boxplot_func\u0026quot; \u0026quot;fahr_to_cel\u0026quot; \u0026quot;mydata\u0026quot; \u0026quot;x1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;x2\u0026quot;\r Now, call the function and make sure it does what we want?\nboxplot_func(mydata, \u0026quot;cat1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;var1\u0026quot;)\r boxplot_func(x = \u0026quot;cat2\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;var1\u0026quot;, col = \u0026quot;darkcyan\u0026quot;)\r boxplot_func(mydata, \u0026quot;cat2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;var4\u0026quot;, col = \u0026quot;khaki\u0026quot;)\r What if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t do what we want? What if you get strange output? No output? Or strange error messages? Herein comes the world of debugging (another blog post for another day).\nError Checking and Error Messages You may have noticed earlier this strange error message:\nfahr_to_cel(\u0026quot;thirty\u0026quot;)\r ## Error in fahr - 32: non-numeric argument to binary operator\r This is a very confusing message. We most certainly provided a \u0026ldquo;non-numeric argument\u0026rdquo;, but what is a \u0026ldquo;binary operator\u0026rdquo;? Turns out that is a programming speak for a standard mathematical operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (called \u0026lsquo;binary\u0026rsquo; because they take two inputs). Still, we are likely to encounter more strange error messages written in programmer speak that confuse us or someone else using our functions. We can write custom error messages that are produced when certain errors occur.\nHere is the temperature conversion function again:\nfahr_to_cel \u0026lt;- function(fahr) {\rcelsius \u0026lt;- ((fahr - 32) * (5 / 9)) return(celsius)\r}\r Since they can only take numeric argument, maybe we can start for checking for this? There are a few options in do this. One of the easiest to use is stopifnot(). This functions takes the general form: stopifnot(\u0026quot;my custom error message\u0026quot; = test). What constitutes a \u0026lsquo;test\u0026rsquo; is an R expression that returns a TRUE or FALSE value after being evaluated. Examples of this are is.character(x), is.NA(x), x \u0026gt; 0 and so on. For each of these statements, the expectation is that R will true a TRUE or FALSE. If the test does not do this reliably (e.g. you may not be able to evaluate x \u0026gt; 0 if x is non-numeric), then a different test is needed.\nIn our case, we can use is.numeric().\nfahr_to_cel \u0026lt;- function(fahr) {\rstopifnot(\u0026quot;input is not numeric\u0026quot; = is.numeric(fahr))\rcelsius \u0026lt;- ((fahr - 32) * (5 / 9)) return(celsius)\r}\r Let\u0026rsquo;s run some test cases:\nfahr_to_cel(30)\r ## [1] -1.111111\r fahr_to_cel(\u0026quot;thirty\u0026quot;)\r ## Error in fahr_to_cel(\u0026quot;thirty\u0026quot;): input is not numeric\r As expected, the first one worked and the second generated an error message.\nNaturally, this is a very trivial example, but if you write more complicated functions with the intent of them automatically accomplishing a goal for you, these error messages can be helpful.\nFunctions and Tidy Evaluation If you\u0026rsquo;ve worked with the tidyverse, you know it handles input a bit differently. In summary, quotes are used far less often. This makes writing function quite challening at times and required the use of the double curly braces, {{}} or the \u0026ldquo;bang-bang\u0026rdquo; operator !!.\nWhat if we wanted to do a boxplot function using ggplot?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what the code would look like:\nlibrary(ggplot2)\rmydata \u0026lt;- data.frame(cat = rep(c(\u0026quot;AA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;BB\u0026quot;), each = 50), obs = c(rnorm(50), runif(50)))\rggplot(mydata, aes(x = cat, y = obs)) +\rgeom_boxplot(aes(fill = cat), alpha = 0.5) +\rgeom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + guides(fill = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_classic()\r But, if you try to write a function following the usual rules, it won\u0026rsquo;t work properly:\ngboxplot_func \u0026lt;- function(x1, y1) {\rggplot(mydata, aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\rgeom_boxplot(aes(fill = x1), alpha = 0.5) +\rgeom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + guides(fill = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_classic()\r}\r gboxplot_func(cat, obs)\r ## Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...): object 'obs' not found\r This one works, but the results are crazy.\ngboxplot_func(\u0026quot;cat\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;obs\u0026quot;)\r Why are the results wonky? Because while this function see \u0026ldquo;mydata\u0026rdquo; has 100 observations, it cannot connect \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;obs\u0026rdquo; to the data frame.\nThis is where the special operators come in:\ngboxplot_func2 \u0026lt;- function(x1, y1) {\rggplot(mydata, aes(x = {{x1}}, y = {{y1}})) +\rgeom_boxplot(aes(fill = {{x1}}), alpha = 0.5) +\rgeom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + guides(fill = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_classic()\r}\r gboxplot_func2(cat, obs)\r The curly braces enable us to insert unquoted tidy variables and use ggplot.\nWhat if you have multiple options to specify in a single arguments? You can use the ... notation (in the final argument):\nvar_sum_funct(storms, day, name)[1:5,] # one grouping factor\r ## # A tibble: 5 × 3\r## name Mean SD\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 AL011993 8.75 13.7 ## 2 AL012000 7.75 0.5 ## 3 AL021992 25.6 0.548\r## 4 AL021994 20.3 0.516\r## 5 AL021999 2.75 0.5\r var_sum_funct(storms, day, name, status)[1:5,] # many grouping factors\r ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'name'.

Unlike SAS, ANOVA functions in R lack a consistent structure, consistent output and the accessory packages for ANOVA display a patchwork of compatibility. The result is that it is easy to misspecify a model or make other mistakes. The information below is intended to serve as a guide through the R ANOVA wilderness.\nPackages Needed There are many packages to load. Here is a (very) brief summary of what each package does.\n   Package Purpose     car Anova() function to extract type III \u0026amp; II sums of squares   lme4 mixed models   nlme mixed models, non-linear models, alternative covariance structures   emmeans for extracting least squares means and contrasts   lmer test improved summary functions of lmer objects   dplyr data organization   forcats for managing categorical data   agridat has many agricultural data sets   agricolae has options for many common agricultural experimental designs    library(car)\rlibrary(lme4)\rlibrary(nlme)\rlibrary(emmeans) #in older version of R, you may need to install \u0026quot;multcompView\u0026quot; separately to access full functionality of the emmeans package\rlibrary(lmerTest)\rlibrary(dplyr)\rlibrary(forcats)\rlibrary(agridat)\r Formula Notation There are some consistent features across ANOVA methods in R. Formula notation is often used in the R syntax for ANOVA functions. It looks like this: $Y ~ X, where Y is the dependent variable (the response) and X is/are the independent variable(s) (e.g. the experimental treatments).\nmy_formula \u0026lt;- formula(Y ~ treatment1 + treatment2)\rclass(my_formula)\r ## [1] \u0026quot;formula\u0026quot;\r my_formula\r ## Y ~ treatment1 + treatment2\r Often the independent variables (i,e, the treatments or the x variables) are expected to be factors, another type of R object:\nmy_var \u0026lt;- c(rep(\u0026quot;low\u0026quot;,5), rep(\u0026quot;high\u0026quot;, 5))\rclass(my_var) #check what variable type it is\r ## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot;\r Although \u0026ldquo;my_var\u0026rdquo; is not type factor, it is type \u0026ldquo;character\u0026rdquo; which is automatically converted to a factor in lm(), lmer(), lme() and many other linear modeling functions. There are some packages that do not follow this convention, so it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to read function documentation, especially if you get unexpected results.\nVariables like year, which are often imported as a number or integer, do need to be converted to a factor or a character variable prior to analysis. Otherwise, they will be interpreted as a number in linear modelling and treated as a covariate, e.g, 2020 would be 2,020. Here is one way to do this conversion:\nmy_factor \u0026lt;- as.character(my_var) # convert to a character\rclass(my_factor) # check variable type to confirm\r ## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot;\r my_factor \u0026lt;- as.factor(my_var) # convert to a factor\rclass(my_factor) # check variable type again to confirm\r ## [1] \u0026quot;factor\u0026quot;\r The choice of whether to convert a categorical variable to a character or factor depends on the comfort of the user with these structures and package requirements.\nSometimes, there is a need to alter the order of treatment levels (that is, how R sees those levels). The default behavior of R is to order categorical levels alphanumerically. However, sometimes there are reasons you may not want this (for example, you want to set a particular reference level as the first factor level).\nBelow is one example of how to reorder factor levels in a variable. The first step is to see which levels are present in the variable and how they are ordered:\nlevels(my_factor)  ## [1] \u0026quot;high\u0026quot; \u0026quot;low\u0026quot;\r Once that is known, you can use that information to manually set the levels and their order. Note that spelling of each level much match what is actually present in the variable. Unmatched levels in the variable will be set to NA automatically by R in the following step.\nmy_factor \u0026lt;- factor(my_factor, levels = c(\u0026quot;low\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;high\u0026quot;)) levels(my_factor) # check the new ordering\r ## [1] \u0026quot;low\u0026quot; \u0026quot;high\u0026quot;\r Knowing the level order is important because in the implementation of ANOVA in R, the first level is treated as the reference level. Manipulating factors is a challenging task in R. The package forcats contains a collection of accessory functions for managing factors (\u0026ldquo;forcats\u0026rdquo; = for categories). The tutorial uses the forcats function fct_drop().\nMore on formulas:\nThe formula first shown, Y ~ treatment1 + treatment2, includes main effects only. Other formula notation includes the symbols : and *, indicating notation for interaction only and main effects plus the interaction term, respectively.\nformula(Y ~ treatment1:treatment2) # interaction only\r ## Y ~ treatment1:treatment2\r formula(Y ~ treatment1*treatment2) # interaction plus main effects\r ## Y ~ treatment1 * treatment2\r These two formulas are equivalent:\nformula(Y ~ treatment1 + treatment2 + treatment1:treatment2) formula(Y ~ treatment1*treatment2)  Perhaps you can see from these examples that formulas are a really just a collections of characters (that is, a string) and exist independent of any data set. Later, we will need to link these formulas to a data set to actually construct a linear model and conduct statistical analysis.\nANOVA for fixed effects models Here is a function for reporting the number of missing data in each column. There are other ways to do this, but I find this function easy enough to write and use.\ncount_na \u0026lt;- function(df) {\rapply(df, 2, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) }\r Completely Randomised design First, load the data set \u0026ldquo;warpbreaks\u0026rdquo; (a data set from base R). This is an old data set with variables for wool type (A and B) and tension on the loom (L, M or H). The response variable is \u0026ldquo;breaks\u0026rdquo;, the number of times the wool thread breaks on industrial looms.\nI always like to have a quick look at the data before running any statistical tests. So, here we go:\ndata(warpbreaks)\rcount_na(warpbreaks)\r ## breaks wool tension ## 0 0 0\r str(warpbreaks)\r ## 'data.frame':\t54 obs. of 3 variables:\r## $ breaks : num 26 30 54 25 70 52 51 26 67 18 ...\r## $ wool : Factor w/ 2 levels \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;B\u0026quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\r## $ tension: Factor w/ 3 levels \u0026quot;L\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;M\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;H\u0026quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 ...\r warpbreaks$wool \u0026lt;- factor(warpbreaks$wool, levels = c(\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;B\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;))\rtable(warpbreaks$wool, warpbreaks$tension)\r ## ## L M H\r## A 9 9 9\r## B 9 9 9\r## C 0 0 0\r hist(warpbreaks$breaks, col = \u0026quot;gold\u0026quot;)\r boxplot(breaks ~ wool, data = warpbreaks, col = \u0026quot;orangered\u0026quot;)\r boxplot(breaks ~ tension, data = warpbreaks, col = \u0026quot;chartreuse\u0026quot;) #why not have colorful plots?\r This data set has 2 treatments. We don\u0026rsquo;t know if there is an interaction between the variables, yet. A good start is to run a linear model using lm() function, the linear regression function. As a reminder, ANOVA is a special case of the linear regression model where the predictors (the experimental treatments) are categories rather than a continuous variable.\n# run standard linear model for main effects only\rlm.mod1 \u0026lt;- lm(breaks ~ wool + tension, data = warpbreaks)\r# extract type III sums of squares from that model\rAnova(lm.mod1, type = \u0026quot;3\u0026quot;)  ## Anova Table (Type III tests)\r## ## Response: breaks\r## Sum Sq Df F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) ## (Intercept) 20827.0 1 154.3226 \u0026lt; 2.2e-16 ***\r## wool 450.7 1 3.3393 0.073614 . ## tension 2034.3 2 7.5367 0.001378 ** ## Residuals 6747.9 50 ## ---\r## Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\r # run a linear model with main effects and interactions\rlm.mod2 \u0026lt;- lm(breaks ~ wool*tension, data = warpbreaks)\r# ...and type III sums of squares Anova(lm.mod2, type = \u0026quot;III\u0026quot;)\r ## Anova Table (Type III tests)\r## ## Response: breaks\r## Sum Sq Df F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) ## (Intercept) 17866.8 1 149.2757 2.426e-16 ***\r## wool 1200.5 1 10.0301 0.0026768 ** ## tension 2468.5 2 10.3121 0.0001881 ***\r## wool:tension 1002.8 2 4.1891 0.0210442 * ## Residuals 5745.1 48 ## ---\r## Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\r FYI\nfunctions only shown as an example and not actually run.\n# this function runs type II sums of squares: Anova(lm.mod2, type = \u0026quot;II\u0026quot;)\r# this function runs type I sums of squares: anova(lm.mod2)\r A few comments on types of sums of squares: \nAs a reminder, the type of sums of squares used in statistical tests can impact the results and subsequent interpretation. Type I, sums of squares tests for statistical significance by adding one variable to the model at time (and hence is also called \u0026ldquo;sequential\u0026rdquo;). If there is any unbalance in the treatments, the type I sums of squares are dependent on the order variables are added to the model and hence is often not the best choice for many agricultural experiment. Type III sums of squares (also called \u0026ldquo;partial\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;marginal\u0026rdquo;) evaluates the statistical significance of variable or interaction, assuming that the other variables are in the model. This is a decent default option. The last option is Type II sums of squares, which is the best option when you are sure there are no interactions between variables.

This in contrast to fixed effects, where the inferences are restricted to the treatment levels tested.\nBlocking factors and Year are often considered random factors because a researcher is not interested in particular years or a blocking factor.

Get the correct R distribution for your operating system. Once downloaded, click on downloaded file, and follow the installation instructions.\nNote that R is updated several times per year. If your installation is a year old or more, consider updating your version of R to the latest version.\nInstalling RStudio Rstudio is not R, rather, it is a user interface for accessing R. It is a complicated interface with many features for developers. Despite its complexity, RStudio is nevertheless a very helpful R user interface for users of all abilities. It can downloaded here. For most users, the free version of \u0026ldquo;RStudio Desktop\u0026rdquo; should be chosen. Once downloaded, click on downloaded file, and follow the installation instructions.\nInstalling Rtools (optional) Only Windows users need to consider this step. This app is for compiling R packages with C, C++ and Fortran code. It is a separate piece of software that has to be downloaded and installed (it is not an R package). Rtools is not needed by all users and if you don\u0026rsquo;t know if you need this, it is absolutely fine to skip this step. If you do think you need this, You can find it here. Download and install.\nSetting up RStudio Setup (optional) This is an optional step, but it is highly recommended. This step will prevent RStudio from saving all of your objects in a session to .Rdata file that is then automatically loaded whenever you open R.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;usethis\u0026quot;); library(usethis)\rusethis::use_blank_slate()\r You can disable this across all projects in R with the drop-down menu Tools \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Global Options\u0026hellip; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; unclick \u0026lsquo;Restore .RData into workspace at startup\u0026rsquo; and set \u0026lsquo;Save workspace to .rRData on exit\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;Never\u0026rsquo;.\nWhy is automatic loading of an .Rdata file not recommended? Because it makes your work less reproducible. You may have created test objects that will unexpectedly interfere with downstream operations or analysis. You may have changed the original data source, but an older version is saved in the .Rdata file. More explanation is given by RStudio.\nIf you are used to opening R and seeing all of your previous objects automatically loaded into the objects pane, this will be an adjustment. The solution is to save your processes into .R scripts that capture all information from packages loaded, file import, all data manipulations and other operations important. If these steps are slow and there is a need to access intermediate objects, these can be saved in tabular formats readable by many applications (e.g. .txt or .csv) or saved as a specific R object (see saveRDS() in the R help files) and reloaded in another session.\nSet up version control (optional) If you use Git or SVN, you can perform Git operations directions from RStudio and interact with remote repositories. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use version control, this step can be skipped. If you do use version control, the command line or other third-party software (e.g. Gitkraken) are fine to use instead or in addition to RStudio\u0026rsquo;s interface. The implementation of git in R is very minimal and supports only a limited number of actions, so you are likely to need other software to perform complicated git actions. It is useful for file additions, commits, pushes and pulls.\nYou can set up Git by going to Tools \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Global Options \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Git/SVN.\nThis is not the right space to provide detailed instructions for using git as an R user, but Jenny Bryan has written a very helpful tutorial covering this subject.\n","date":1618444800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618444800,"objectID":"8b70804b6afa070131995606b8772ebd","permalink":"/post/getting-r-setup/","publishdate":"2021-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-r-setup/","section":"post","summary":"Some instructions for R installation and your R setup to support reproducible research.","tags":null,"title":"Getting R Set Up","type":"post"},{"authors":["Julia Piaskowski"],"categories":["R","reproducible research"],"content":"Make sure your Rstudio session is not saving .RData automatically: Note: this step requires the usethis package; please install this package if you do not already have it installed.\nStep 1 is to disable automatic saving of your objects to a .RData file. This file is automatically loaded when R restarts. Since we often create all sorts of miscellaneous objects during a session with a clear record of why, loading all objects without a clear sense of their provenance is often not reproducible by other.\nusethis::use_blank_slate()\r You can read more about this function in its documentation.\nYou can disable this across all projects in R with the drop-down menu Tools \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Global Options\u0026hellip; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; unclick \u0026lsquo;Restore .RData into workspace at startup\u0026rsquo; and set \u0026lsquo;Save workspace to .rRData on exit\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;Never\u0026rsquo;.\nSave all code you run in an .R or .Rmd file This is your source code. It\u0026rsquo;s as real and as important as your input data. This file should capture a set of actions that can be repeated by another person (e.g. your PI, other colleagues yourself in the future) including packages loaded, files imported, all data manipulations and the outputs from these actions (e.g. visualisations, analytical outcomes). The idea is to capture your thought process and specific actions so this can be repeated in full. In most analyses, it is extremely likely* you will revisit a project and need to repeat what has already been done! Keeping a record of actions will save you considerable time because you will not have to attempt to recall and/or reconstruct exactly what you did in previous sessions.\n*Consider yourself very lucky if this does not happen!\nRegularly restart your R session Yes, that means wiping all the loaded packaged and objects from the session (if you followed the first recommendation in these instructions), but the upside is that your analysis are reproducible. This means future you can repeat those analyses and get the same results back you did earlier.\nYou can restart R by manually closing and opening RStudio. You can also restart the R session with RStudio by navigating to the menu item Session \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Restart R.\nUse R projects This is optional, but it will make your life easier. Whenever you start a new analytical endeavor in R, create an R project by navigating to File \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; New Project in RStudio. There are many options available for setting the [project directory (where the .Rproj file lives), the type of project (e.g. R package, Shiny app or blank), and options to initialise a git repo. The simplest option is to choose New Project (no special type) in a dedicated directory. The main advantage of projects is that by opening an .Rproj file, the working directory is automatically set to that directory. If you are using a cloud solution for working across different computers or working with collaborators, this will make things easier because you can use relative paths for importing data and outputting files. There would be no more need for this at the top of your script:\nsetwd(\u0026quot;specific/path/to/my/computer\u0026quot;)\r Additionally, for setting up gitbooks through \u0026lsquo;bookdown\u0026rsquo;, R packages, Shiny apps, and other complicated R endeavors, the automated set-up through R projects can be immensely helpful. This is sometimes referred to as \u0026ldquo;project-oriented workflow.\u0026rdquo; In addition to using R projects with a dedicated directory for each research project, I also prefer to have a consistent directory structure for each project like this one:\ntop-level-directory\r│ README.md\r│\r└───data\r│ │ file011.txt\r│ │ file012.txt\r│ │\r│ └───spatial_files\r│ │ file208.dbf\r│ │ file208.shp\r│ │ file208.shx\r│ └───scripts\r│ │ eda.R\r│ │ analysis.R\r│ │ plots.R\r│ │ final_report.Rmd\r|\r└───outputs\r│ │ plot1.png\r│ │ blups.csv\r|\r└───extra\r│ some_paper.pdf\r│ ...\r I put all raw data needed for analysis into the \u0026lsquo;data\u0026rsquo; directory, any and all programming scripts in the \u0026lsquo;scripts\u0026rsquo; directory, all outputs (plots, tables, intermediate data object) in the \u0026lsquo;outputs\u0026rsquo; directory and everything else ends up \u0026lsquo;extra\u0026rsquo;. Naturally, there are many different directory structures to use and this is just one example. Find something that works best for your needs!\nUse the \u0026lsquo;here\u0026rsquo; package. This is also optional. It works like R projects for setting the working directory. However, for an R project to work, you have to open the .Rproj file in RStudio. What if you or your collaborators prefer to open R files directly and start using those? Here will look for the next directory level which there is a .Rproj file and set the working directory there.\nIf you want to import a file, \u0026ldquo;datafile.csv\u0026rdquo; that located in the data directory. Your .R script is actually located in the \u0026lsquo;scripts\u0026rsquo; directory. Normally, if you try to read that in, you need to specify the full path to \u0026ldquo;mydata.csv\u0026rdquo; or set the working directory and use a relative path. Again, these paths will not work if you switch computers or your collaborators are running these scripts on their own systems. This system gets even more complicated when working with an .Rmd file. Here\u0026rsquo;s an alternative approach that works the same across files and systems:\nFirst, make sure you have .Rproj file to define the top-level directory.\nlibrary(here)\rmydata \u0026lt;- read.csv(here(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;datafile.csv\u0026quot;))\r This code will construct this path: \u0026ldquo;data/datafile.csv\u0026rdquo; and execute that command under the assumption that wherever that .rproj is located (going up one directory at a time until it finds it) is where the working directory is set. Putting library(here) into every .R or .Rmd file in a project will resolve these issues.\nUse R environments. Again: optional, but it will make your life easier.\nOften in academia, I might do an analysis, move on to something else and then have to return that analysis months or years later. I probably will have updated R and some or all of the packages used in that analysis. As a result of these updates, my original code may not work at all or may not do the intended actions. What I need are both the older version of R and the older packages. The package \u0026lsquo;renv\u0026rsquo; is a solution. It captures the versions of R and the loaded packages. It also builds a custom package library for your package (and caches this information across other projects using renv).\nStart here: (you need to also be using Rprojects since renv is searching for .Rproj file)\nlibrary(renv)\rrenv::init()\r If you have a mature project that\u0026rsquo;s not undergoing any further development at this time, this is all you need to do.\nIf you continue to develop your project and install new packages, update your R environment like thus to ensure new or updated packaged are included:\nrenv::snapshot()\r If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with Packrat, this is a replacement for that. This is particularly helpful for things that may have a long life span, like Shiny apps. The renv package has extensive documentation worth reading.\nFinal Comments There are many more resources and recommendations for conducting reproducible research in R.
